In this lecture I learnt about how to create your own react library and jsx.
We end up deleting and changing a lot of files everytime we create a react app.

To solve this issue, we can create our own custom template where we can have the files we want and the content in those files as per your requirement.

1.personalised react library and jsx
new folder->custom react->index.html
                        ->custom react.js

on vite
main.js
